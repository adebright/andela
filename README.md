Andela is one of the leading tech companies in sub-saharan Africa with major contribution to the tech ecosystem especially in Nigeria.

The purpose was to focus on :
1. HTML with imperative css classes 
1. Adhere strictly to HTML5 semantic tags 
1. Reduction in the file size - This was well achieved
